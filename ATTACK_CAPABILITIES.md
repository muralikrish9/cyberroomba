# ⚔️ CyberRoomba Attack Capabilities

## 🎯 From Mass Scanner to Full Attack Platform

CyberRoomba is now a **complete bug bounty automation platform** with both reconnaissance AND attack capabilities.

## 🔍 Reconnaissance Phase
- **Subdomain Discovery**: Subfinder, Amass
- **HTTP Probing**: httpx for alive hosts
- **Technology Detection**: Automated tech stack identification
- **Port Scanning**: Nmap for open ports

## 🚨 Vulnerability Scanning Phase
- **Nuclei Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Nmap Vulnerability Scripts**: Deep port and service analysis
- **CVE Matching**: Automatic CVE correlation

## ⚔️ Attack Phase (Nuclei Templates!)

### 1. General Nuclei Attack Templates
- **Tool**: Nuclei with 5000+ attack templates
- **Techniques**: 
  - SQL injection attacks
  - Command injection
  - File inclusion attacks
  - Server-side template injection
  - And hundreds more!
- **Templates**: All vulnerability and exposure templates
- **Output**: Live attack execution and results

### 2. XSS Attack Templates
- **Tool**: Nuclei XSS-specific templates
- **Techniques**:
  - Reflected XSS detection
  - Stored XSS detection
  - DOM-based XSS detection
  - XSS payload injection
- **Templates**: vulnerabilities/xss/, exposures/
- **Output**: Live XSS attack results

### 3. Path Discovery Templates
- **Tool**: Nuclei path/exposure templates
- **Techniques**:
  - Admin panel discovery
  - Backup file detection
  - Configuration file exposure
  - Debug interface detection
- **Templates**: exposures/, misconfiguration/
- **Output**: Live exposed path discovery

### 4. Authentication Bypass Templates
- **Tool**: Nuclei auth bypass templates
- **Techniques**:
  - Default credential testing
  - Authentication bypass attempts
  - Weak authentication detection
  - No authentication required detection
- **Templates**: vulnerabilities/auth/, vulnerabilities/default-login/
- **Output**: Live authentication bypass results

## 🎯 Attack Pipeline

```
Target → Recon → Vuln Scan → ATTACKS → Reports → Discord
```

### Attack Command:
```bash
npm run attacks:run
```

### What You'll See:
```
⚔️ Starting attack phase on 3 alive hosts...

📊 Attack Progress: 1/3 hosts

⚔️ [attacks] Starting attack phase on: example.com
   Target: example.com (bugcrowd:example)
   Attack URL: http://example.com
   
   ⚔️ Phase 1: Nuclei Attack Templates...
      ⚔️ Running Nuclei attack templates on: http://example.com
      🚨 [CRITICAL] SQL Injection in login form - 2025-01-10T15:30:45Z
      🚨 [HIGH] Command Injection via file upload - 2025-01-10T15:30:50Z

      🔓 Auth Bypass: Default credentials admin:admin - 2025-01-10T15:31:30Z
      
   🎯 Stored 6 successful attacks in database
   📢 Sent Discord notification for critical attack: SQL Injection
   📢 Sent Discord notification for high attack: Command Injection
   ✅ Attack phase complete for example.com - 6 successful attacks
```

## 🚨 Discord Notifications

All successful attacks are automatically sent to Discord with:
- **Severity-based routing** (Critical/High/Medium channels)
- **Real-time notifications** as attacks succeed
- **Detailed evidence** including payloads and responses
- **Attack vectors** and techniques used

## 📊 Attack Results

Successful attacks are stored as vulnerabilities with:
- **Attack vector details**
- **Payload information**
- **Response evidence**
- **Confidence levels**
- **Severity ratings**

## 🛠️ Required Tools

See `TOOLS_SETUP.md` for installation instructions:
- **Nuclei** (with 5000+ attack templates)
- **Nuclei Templates** (updated regularly with new attacks)

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

- **Only scans authorized bug bounty targets**
- **Respects rate limits and timeouts**
- **Uses responsible disclosure practices**
- **Follows bug bounty program rules**

## 🎯 Next Steps

To add more attack capabilities:
1. **Subdomain takeover detection**
2. **SSRF testing**
3. **XXE injection**
4. **Command injection**
5. **File upload vulnerabilities**
6. **Business logic flaws**

CyberRoomba is now a **complete offensive security automation platform**! 🚀
